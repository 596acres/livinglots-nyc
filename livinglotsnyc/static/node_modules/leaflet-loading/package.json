  "readme": "Leaflet.loading\n===============\n\nLeaflet.loading is a simple loading control for [Leaflet][]. An unobtrusive\nloading indicator is added below the zoom control if one exists. The indicator\nis visible when tiles are loading or when other data is loading, as indicated by\nfiring custom events on a map. The indicator can be an image, or a [spin.js][] \nspinner (image-less).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nLeaflet.loading is only tested on Leaflet version 0.6 or greater. It will almost\ncertainly not work with older versions of Leaflet.\n\nInclude `Control.Loading.js` and `Control.Loading.css`, then create a map with \n`loadingControl: true` in its options. \n\nBy default, Leaflet.loading includes a base64-encoded animagted loading image in \n`Control.Loading.css`. You can customize this by changing `background-image` for\nthe selector `.leaflet-control-loading`. The simplest case would be adding a 16\nx 16 loading gif in `.leaflet-control-loading`.\n\nYou can also set `spinjs: true` in the options, and load [spin.js][] to use that\ninstead of an image. A spin.js options object can be passed as the spin key when\ninitializing the control.\n\nWhichever method you use, make sure you only use one.\n\nOnce the above is complete you will have a loading indicator that only appears\nwhen tiles are loading. \n\nIf you want to show the loading indicator while other AJAX requests or something\nelse is occurring, simply fire the `dataloading` event on your map when you \nbegin loading and `dataload` when you are finished loading. The control tracks \nthe number of concurrent loaders, so it is your responsibility to ensure that \nthe `dataloading` and `dataload` are called symmetrically.\n\n### Options\n\n - **position**: (string) Where you want the control to show up on the map (standard\n   Leaflet control option). Optional, defaults to `topleft`\n - **separate**: (boolean) Whether the control should be separate from the zoom\n   control or not, defaults to false.\n - **zoomControl**: (L.Control.Zoom) The zoom control that the control should be\n   added to. This is only necessary when adding a loading control to a zoom \n   control that you added manually and do not want a separate loading control.\n - **spinjs**: (boolean) Enable the use of [spin.js][]. Optional, defaults to \n   `false`\n - **spin**: (object) A [spin.js][] options object. Optional, defaults to \n\n    ```\n    { \n        lines: 7,\n        length: 3,\n        width: 3,\n        radius: 5,\n        rotate: 13,\n        top: \"83%\" \n    }\n    ```\n\n\n## Demos\n\nSee Leaflet.loading in action (zoom or pan to make tiles load):\n\n - Using the [simplest setup][simple], with the loading indicator attached to\n   the zoom control.\n - With the loading indicator [separate][] from the zoom control.\n - With the loading indicator and zoom control on the [top right][topright] of\n   the map.\n - The [simplest example using spin.js](http://ebrelsford.github.io/Leaflet.loading/spinjs.html) instead of an image\n - Combined with a [fullscreen control][combined] (e.g. [leaflet.fullscreen][]).\n\n\n## License\n\nLeaflet.loading is free software, and may be redistributed under the MIT\nLicense.\n\n\n [Leaflet]: https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet\n [spin.js]: https://github.com/fgnass/spin.js/\n [simple]: http://ebrelsford.github.io/Leaflet.loading/simple.html\n [separate]: http://ebrelsford.github.io/Leaflet.loading/separate.html\n [topright]: http://ebrelsford.github.io/Leaflet.loading/topright.html\n [combined]: http://ebrelsford.github.io/Leaflet.loading/combined.html\n [leaflet.fullscreen]: https://github.com/brunob/leaflet.fullscreen\n",
