This example demonstrates usage of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) mapping library with HTML5 Web Workers.

`L.TileLayer.Canvas` is used to visualize different types of fractals. All rendering is performed in Web Workers resulting in smooth user interaction.

Many thanks to @calvinmetcalf for significant example improvements!
